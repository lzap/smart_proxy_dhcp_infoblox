# SmartProxyDhcpInfoblox

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/theforeman/smart_proxy_dhcp_infoblox.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/theforeman/smart_proxy_dhcp_infoblox)

This plugin adds a new DHCP provider for managing records with infoblox servers

## Installation

See [How_to_Install_a_Smart-Proxy_Plugin](http://projects.theforeman.org/projects/foreman/wiki/How_to_Install_a_Smart-Proxy_Plugin)
for how to install Smart Proxy plugins

This plugin is compatible with Smart Proxy 1.11 or higher.

When installing using "gem", make sure to install the bundle file:

    echo "gem 'smart_proxy_dhcp_infoblox'" > /usr/share/foreman-proxy/bundler.d/dhcp_infoblox.rb

## Configuration

To enable this DHCP provider, edit `/etc/foreman-proxy/settings.d/dhcp.yml` and set:

    :use_provider: dhcp_infoblox
    :server: IP of infoblox server
    :subnets: subnets you want to use (optional unless you set infoblox_subnets to false)

Configuration options for this plugin are in `/etc/foreman-proxy/settings.d/dhcp_infoblox.yml` and include:

* username: API Username
* password: API Password
* record_type: host / fixedaddress (see different record types chapter)

## Different record types
The main difference between host and fixedaddress is that a host record already includes the dns records. It's an infoblox object that includes dhcp/a record/ptr records. If you use the host objects there is no need to use a dns smart proxy. Everything gets handled inside the dhcp smart proxy. This does however limit functionality. You can't delete conflicting records or you can't change dns names using foreman gui. Beware when editing host objects manually in infoblox, once you delete a host in foreman all associated host objects get deleted.

If you chose to use fixedaddress you'll need to use the infoblox dns smart proxy (https://github.com/theforeman/smart_proxy_dns_infoblox) if you want to manage dns records.

## SSL

The plugin enforces HTTPS server certificate verification. Follow a standard CA cert installation procedure for your operating system. It's possible to either download the server certificate from Infoblox web UI or use openssl command to extract it from server response. Here are example steps for Red Hat compatible systems:

```
# update-ca-trust enable
# openssl s_client -showcerts -connect 192.168.201.2:443 </dev/null | openssl x509 -text >/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/infoblox.crt
# update-ca-trust extract
```

For Debian-compatible systems:

```
# openssl s_client -showcerts -connect 192.168.201.2:443 </dev/null | openssl x509 -text >/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/infoblox.crt
# update-ca-certificates
```

To test the CA certificate, a simple curl query can be used. This is a positive test:

```
# curl -u admin:infoblox https://192.168.201.2/wapi/v2.0/network
[
    {
        "_ref": "network/ZG5zLm5ldHdvcmskMTkyLjE2OC4yMDIuMC8yNC8w:192.168.202.0/24/default",
        "network": "192.168.202.0/24",
        "network_view": "default"
    }
]
```

And a negative one:

```
# curl -u admin:infoblox https://192.168.201.2/wapi/v2.0/network
curl: (60) SSL certificate problem: self signed certificate
```
